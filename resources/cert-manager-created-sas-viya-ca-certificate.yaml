## Example cert-manager certificate resource to used to create the TLS certificate secret used by ingress controllers
##
## In the following code, the locations that require user specified values are indicated by a capitalized and
## hyphenated name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. You should replace this token with the
## actual value.
## Replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name.
## For instance, "{{ INGRESS_DNS_ALIAS }}" should be replaced with the DNS alias used to reach the ingress controller
## of your cluster.   Typically your IT organization will provide you with this value.
## At least one DNS Name or IP address is required.  If your ingress controller has only one alias, as is typical, you
## should delete the line that shows a second dnsNames: placeholder value.
## It is not typical to use IP addresses to reach the ingress controller.  Unless your IT department suggests using IP
## addresses, you should remove the entire ipAddresses: section including both the lines containing placeholder values.
##
## If your ingress controller DNS alias is myhostname.mycompany.com and you were not instructed to supply IP addresses,
## the correct, final syntax would be:
## dnsNames:
##    - myhostname.mycompany.com
## secretName: sas-viya-ca-certificate-secret
