# User-defined values are indicated by a capitalized and hyphenated name set
# off by curly braces and a space at each end. To replace the variable, replace the
# curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name.
#
# The variables are as follows:
# - {{ POSTGRES-STORAGE-SIZE }} is the PostgreSQL PVCs' storage size
# - {{ BACKREST-STORAGE-SIZE }} is the pgBackrest PVC storage size
# - {{ POSTGRES-ACCESS-MODE }} is the access mode for the PostgreSQL PVCs
# - {{ BACKREST-ACCESS-MODE }} is the access mode for the pgBackRest PVCs
# - odf-storagecluster-ceph-rbd is the storage class for the PostgreSQL PVCs
# - odf-storagecluster-ceph-rbd is the storage class for all pgBackRest PVCs
# - {{ CLUSTER-NAME }} is the name of the PostgresCluster resource you are targeting:
#   - For Platform PostgreSQL, use "sas-crunchy-platform-postgres"
#   - For CDS PostgreSQL, use "sas-crunchy-cds-postgres"
#
# Notes:
# - Storage size variables should be Kubernetes storage sizes, such as "256Gi" or "2048Mi"
# - Access mode variables should be valid Kubernetes PVC access mode, such as "ReadWriteOnce" or "ReadWriteMany"
# - Storage class variables should match existing storage classes in your Kubernetes cluster
